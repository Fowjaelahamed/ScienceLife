            <p>A long-predicted type of cosmic explosion has finally burst onto the scene.
                Researchers have found convincing evidence for an electron-capture supernova, a stellar explosion
                ignited when atomic nuclei sop up electrons within a star’s core. The phenomenon was first predicted in
                1980, but scientists have never been sure that they have seen one. A flare that appeared in the sky in
                2018, called supernova 2018zd, matches several expected hallmarks of the blasts, scientists report June
                28 in Nature Astronomy.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational waves</h2>
            <h3>An elusive source of ripples in spacetime</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Caught in a fatal inward spiral, a neutron star met its end when a black hole swallowed it whole.
                Gravitational ripples from that collision spread outward through the cosmos, eventually reaching Earth.
                The
                detection of those waves marks the first reported sighting of a black hole engulfing the dense remnant
                of
                dead star. And in a surprise twist, scientists spotted a second such merger just days after the first.

                <h3>An atomic clock that could revolutionize space travel</h3>
                <h4>By <span class="blue">Emily Conover</span></h4>
                <p>An atomic clock that could transform deep-space travel has successfully completed its first test run
                    in space.
                    NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock, which launched on a satellite in June 2019, outperformed all other
                    clocks in space during its first year in orbit around Earth. The clock, DSAC for short, was at least
                    10 times more stable than clocks on GPS satellites, which makes it reliable enough for futuristic
                    space navigation schemes, researchers report online June 30 in Nature.</p>

                <h3>This moon-sized white dwarf is the smallest ever found</h3>
                <h4>By <span class="blue">Emily Conover</span></h4>
                <p>Only a smidge bigger than the moon, a newfound white dwarf is the smallest of its kind known.
                    The white dwarf, a type of remnant left behind when certain stars peter out, has a radius of about
                    2,100 kilometers, researchers report June 30 in Nature. That’s remarkably close to the moon’s
                    approximately 1,700-kilometer radius. Most white dwarfs are closer to the size of Earth, which has a
                    radius of about 6,300 kilometers.</p>
